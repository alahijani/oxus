# Oxus Prelude

The Oxus Prelude is a and alternative standard library (a predule) for a dependently typed language. Oxus is written in [Idris](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev), and our inital goal is to augment the Idris standard library. 

Even though we are building on top of Idris, we won't shy away from duplicating its functionality from time to time. Our goal is to eventually reduce our dependency on the Idris standard library to such an extent that Oxus can be ported to other dependently typed languages.
